## Timeline

### Day 3
- Started the desktop 1440x layout and did some ajustments in the HTML, to properly style in the media queries.

### Day 4

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive layout approach

### What I learned
Learned to do a form validation with a custom message without using JS (server-side validation)

```css
section .emailbox:not(:focus):not(:placeholder-shown):invalid ~ .error-message {
    display: block;
}
```
### Continued development

I will try to improve the use of certain functions so as not to make the code too repetitive, having to repeat or modify too many functions when adapting to different layouts.
